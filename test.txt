[33m[1m   Warning: [0m[33m[0mPackage 'nim_tiled' has an incorrect structure. The top level of the package source directory should contain at most one module, named 'nim_tiled.nim', but a file named 'zlib.nim' was found. This will be an error in the future.
[33m[1m      Hint: [0m[33m[0mIf this is the primary source file in the package, rename it to 'nim_tiled.nim'. If it's a source file required by the main module, or if it is one of several modules exposed by 'nim_tiled', then move it into a 'nim_tiled/' subdirectory. If it's a test file or otherwise not required to build the the package 'nim_tiled.nim', prevent its installation by adding `skipFiles = @["zlib.nim"]` to the .nimble file. See https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#libraries for more info.
